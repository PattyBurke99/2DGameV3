Source code for a 2D game prototype made entirely by me in the Unity game engine sometime in 2018 or 2019. The game code is written in C#. The game features network multiplayer using Unity's old high level networking API (now deprecated). The game features guns that can be picked up and shot, a basic working inventory system, and a basic chunk loading algorithm that loads and unloads area of the (large but empty) game world as players move around the map. The C# source files I wrote for the game are located in the Assets/Scripts directory.
